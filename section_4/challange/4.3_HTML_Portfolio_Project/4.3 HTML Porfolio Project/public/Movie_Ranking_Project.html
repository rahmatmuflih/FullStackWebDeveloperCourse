    <h1>The Best Movies According to Muflih</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-Time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Guardians of The Galaxy</h3>
    <p>
      I love how sci-fi and adventure blend into one movie, <br />
      despite this movie is part of mcu, you can watch this <br />
      movie without watch the other mcu film. The story maybe <br />
      didnt explain all main protagonist, but how james gunn <br />
      deliver the stories is good, how he come up with funny <br />
      theme and how he ends the story, its all good, and that <br />
      is why this movie is awesome.
    </p>
    <h3>Up</h3>
    <p>
      First i hate romance movie, but this is movie is good. <br />
      i love how the movie thought us to live your life and <br />
      keep move on. The adventure gives us some awe moment <br />
      that keep us wonder how the story goes. The good part is <br />
      this movie has good ending.
    </p>
    <h3>Silent Voice</h3>
    <p>
      Silent Voice is good anime with some pychology science <br />
      that make me want cry in the half of the movie. How the <br />
      character has low esteem about his environtment because <br />
      of his past. Conflict in this film is good like there is <br />
      three bestfriend and they are not anymore when they become <br />
      adult. One of them blame deaf girl that involve between three <br />
      of them. After all, the movie was really good, especially when <br />
      the main character start to accept his surroundings and he cried, <br />
      it give me awe momment and i cry a little bit .
